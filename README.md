Real Time Indian Sign Language Recognition Using Nvidia Jetson Nano


Communication is very significant to human beings as it facilitates the spread of knowledge and 
forms relationships between people. We communicate through speech, facial expressions, hand 
signs, reading, writing or drawing etc. But speech is the most commonly used mode of 
communication. However, people with hearing and speaking disability only communicate through 
signs, which makes them highly dependent on non-verbal forms of communication. India is a vast 
country, having nearly five million people deaf and hearing impaired. Still very limited work has 
been done in this research area, because of its complex nature. Indian Sign Language is 
predominantly used in South Asian countries.
The purpose of this project is to recognize all the alphabets (A-Z) and digits (0-9) of Indian sign 
language using a machine learning model and convert them to text. The dataset for this system is 
created manually in different hand orientations and lighting. Pre-processing of images has been 
done for better results. Our model has then been deployed on Nvidia Jetson Nano, thus allowing us 
to work in real time.
